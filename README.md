#  VIRUS-DATA GAME  
# Web-Based Mini Game

A fast-paced, browser-based mini game built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, designed for **short 1–2 minute play sessions** at stall events and demos. The game introduces players to a cybersecurity-inspired theme where they collect data packets while avoiding viruses.




# Game Concept

**Objective**

* Collect as many **data packets** as possible
* Avoid **viruses** that reduce your firewall (lives)
* Survive until the timer ends or until all firewalls are lost

**Theme:** Cybersecurity / Data Protection



##  Gameplay Features

*  **Simple controls** – move the player using mouse movement
*  **Timed gameplay** – 60-second sessions, perfect for stall demos
*  **Dynamic difficulty** – virus spawn rate increases as time passes
*  **Firewall system** – player starts with 3 lives
*  **Floating score effects** – visual +1 / -1 feedback on collisions
*  **Sound effects** – for data collection, virus hits, and game over



## Tech Stack

* **HTML5** – game structure
* **CSS3** – layout, animations, and visual effects
* **JavaScript** – game logic, collision detection, timers
